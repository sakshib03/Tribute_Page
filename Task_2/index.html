                <h2>First Indian woman to go the space and created a history in the<br> field of science.</h2>
                <p><b>PERSONAL DATA:</b> Born in Kamal, India. Died on February 1, 2003 over the southern United 
                    States when Space Shuttle Columbia and her crew perished during entry, 16 minutes prior to scheduled
                    landing. She is survived by her husband. Kalpana Chawla enjoyed flying, hiking, back-packing, and 
                    reading. She held a Certificated Flight Instructor's license with airplane and glider ratings, 
                    Commercial Pilot's licenses for single- and multi-engine land and seaplanes, and Gliders, and 
                    instrument rating for airplanes. She enjoyed flying aerobatics and tail-wheel airplanes.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p><b>EDUCATION:</b> Graduated from Tagore School, Karnal, India, in 1976. Bachelor of science degree 
                    in aeronautical engineering from Punjab Engineering College, India, 1982. Master of science degree 
                    in aerospace engineering from University of Texas, 1984. Doctorate of philosophy in aerospace 
                    engineering from University of Colorado, 1988.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p><b>AWARDS:</b> Posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the NASA Space Flight 
                    Medal, and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p><b>EXPERIENCE:</b> In 1988, Kalpana Chawla started work at NASA Ames Research Center in the area 
                    of powered-lift computational fluid dynamics. Her research concentrated on simulation of complex 
                    air flows encountered around aircraft such as the Harrier in "ground-effect." Following completion 
                    of this project she supported research in mapping of flow solvers to parallel computers, and testing
                     of these solvers by carrying out powered lift computations. In 1993 Kalpana Chawla joined 
                     Overset Methods Inc., Los Altos, California, as Vice President and Research Scientist to form a 
                     team with other researchers specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. She was 
                     responsible for development and implementation of efficient techniques to perform aerodynamic 
                     optimization Results of various projects that Kalpana Chawla participated in are documented in 
                     technical conference papers and journals.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p><b>NASA EXPERIENCE:</b> Selected by NASA in December 1994, Kalpana Chawla reported to the Johnson 
                    Space Center in March 1995 as an astronaut candidate in the 15th Group of Astronauts. After 
                    completing a year of training and evaluation, she was assigned as crew representative to work
                    technical issues for the Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branches. Her assignments 
                    included work on development of Robotic Situational Awareness Displays and testing space 
                    shuttle control software in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory. In November, 1996, 
                    Kalpana Chawla was assigned as mission specialist and prime robotic arm operator on STS-87. 
                    In January 1998, she was assigned as crew representative for shuttle and station flight crew 
                    equipment, and subsequently served as lead for Astronaut Office's Crew Systems and Habitability 
                    section. She flew on STS-87 (1997) and STS-107 (2003), logging 30 days, 14 hours and 54 minutes 
                    in space</p>
                <br></br>
                <p><b>SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:</b> STS-87 Columbia (November 19 to December 5, 1997). STS-87 was the 
                    fourth US Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments designed to study how the 
                    weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and on observations of 
                    the Sun's outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an EVA (spacewalk) 
                    which featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite, in addition to testing EVA tools 
                    and procedures for future Space Station assembly. STS-87 made 252 orbits of the Earth, 
                    traveling 6.5 million miles in in 376 hours and 34 minutes.<br> STS-107 Columbia (January 16 
                    to February 1, 2003). The 16-day flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 
                    24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 
                    experiments. The STS-107 mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003 when Space Shuttle Columbia 
                    and the crew perished during entry. 16 minutes prior to scheduled landing.</p>
